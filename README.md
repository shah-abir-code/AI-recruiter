Overview

AI Recruiter is an intelligent system designed to streamline and automate the recruitment process. It leverages artificial intelligence and natural language processing to analyze resumes, match candidates with job requirements, and provide recruiters with actionable insights. This reduces manual effort, saves time, and ensures more accurate hiring decisions.

Problem

Recruitment can be a time-consuming and error-prone process. Some common challenges include:

Screening hundreds or thousands of resumes manually.
